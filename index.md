## Eligibility

Challenge problems are open to academia, small and large businesses, national laboratories, both in the U.S. and internationally.  Data packages will be publicly released by AFRL and made available to participants.  Contact information will be required for accessing data packages to allow for challenge updates to be communicated, but does not obligate participation.  Submissions will be kept private during grading, but will be shared anonymously as an aggregate after grading.  Only AFRL will know the identity associated with each submission at any time.  An exception is if a participant is selected as a Top Performer in one of the challenges, then that participant must agree to openly associate their identity with the submission.  Participants will be informed of their submission’s grade/quality and can see other submissions in an anonymous form in a debrief document/journal article.  Participants interested in having their submission graded, but not considered for an award, may discuss with AFRL regarding inclusion in the anonymous aggregate.  Any questions regarding eligibility to participate or accept awards can be addressed to AFRL through the challenge participation site. 

## Awards

Challenge problems will have an associated monetary and/or resource award to be issued to Top Performers.  Exact details of the breakdown of prize money/resources is under development and award amounts will be communicated through the challenge participation site and may be determined by number of participants.  Likely, winners and runners-up of each challenge will be awarded prizes.  An independent third-party will coordinate awards with selected Top Performers.

## Logistics 

Data packages will carry unlimited data rights to the participants with proper citation.  Submissions will be the property of the corresponding participant and not circulated by AFRL.  AFRL is requesting rights to use the submissions in derivative work, but will not distribute any portions of the submissions directly without approval of the corresponding participants.  Participants will be asked to submit results and relevant details of their simulation procedure using a template provided with the challenge problem data package.  The simulation details will be treated with the same rights and procedures as the results themselves.  It should be noted that AFRL is not setting any constraints on the modeling approaches allowed by participants.  Further, any additional information available in literature can be utilized by participants, but should be reported with the submission.
